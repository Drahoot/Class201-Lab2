      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Ryan and I am 22 years old and just going into the tech industry. I have completed some college but not enough for a degree, despite that I am currently working towards certification in the coding field through Code Fellows. Its a nice change of pace from my previous industry which I worked in for about three years being the automotive industry, especailly since I don't know anything about cars. A goal that I want to achieve is to get into this industry and shoot for a goal of 80k a year profit.</p>
