Reflections and Comments
- new way of syntax learned today, learned to how to ACP using git commands to Github.
- Learned a new way of combining a string and function together using (`${}`)
- syntax as usual can be pretty tricky, especially with a bigger file being worked on.
- repetition seemed to be key for if else statements that rely on yes or no
- JavaScript is a loose and dynamic language, Dynamic meaning that I can change the type of data after the variable has been declared
- Variables can have a set assigned value that doesnt change or can have one that changes based on user input
- IF ELSE conditionals are practical and kinda fun to use honestly
