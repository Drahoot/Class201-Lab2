Reflections and Comments
- new way of syntax learned today, learned to how to ACP using git commands to Github.
- Learned a new way of combining a string and function together using (`${}`)
- syntax as usual can be pretty tricky, especially with a bigger file being worked on.
- repetition seemed to be key for if else statements that rely on yes or no
- I need to practice my css more
